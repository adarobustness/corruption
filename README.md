# Image and Text Corruptions
This repo aims to synthesis natural distribution shifts on image and text datasets. 
We provide a set of image and text corruptions that are easy to use and can be applied to any image and text datasets. 
Specifically, this repo is designed for the paper [Benchmarking Robustness of Adaptation Methods on Pre-trained Vision-Language Models
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02080) which introduces 7 benchmark datasets, including 96 visual and 87 textual corruptions.
